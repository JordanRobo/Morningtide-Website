			answer: "The pivot from long-range plans to agile capability-building. Schools aren’t chasing five-year utopias anymore—they're focusing on being responsive, resilient, and ready to move quickly. Strategy is less about predicting the future and more about preparing for it."
		},
		{
			question: "Do we really need a strategic plan if everything changes so fast?",
			answer: "Yes—but not the 40-page shelf-warmer you reviewed once and forgot. Modern strategy is about structured focus: clarifying your priorities, aligning your teams, and creating the conditions for confident decision-making. It's your school’s filter, not a crystal ball."
		},
		{
			question: "How do we balance innovation with tradition?",
			answer: "Strategically. You don’t ditch the past—you reframe it. The best schools are drawing from their heritage while deliberately prototyping new models in small, low-risk ways. Think “tradition with traction” rather than “nostalgia with inertia.”"
		},
		{
			question: "What’s the most underrated strategic priority in schools right now?",
			answer: "Staff experience. Not just retention, but making your school a place where professionals thrive. In a tight talent market, your culture is a competitive advantage—and a key determinant of student success. Happy staff, better outcomes. Simple."

				Why does strategy often fail in execution? The issue is rarely the strategy itself — more often, it’s the systems and structures that are not equipped to deliver it. The complexity of designing

			<p>The Strategy Cheat Sheet is designed to do one thing: help you cut through the noise and make strategy doable.</p>
			<p>
				It breaks the process into five clear stages—Review, Inspire, Design, Goals, Execute—and gives you practical actions, checklists, and tools to move each one forward. Think of it as a strategic
				GPS: it tells you where you are, where you’re headed, and what you might be missing along the way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even better? It’s built specifically for Independent Schools. No generic frameworks, no MBA jargon—just smart, structured prompts you can walk through with your leadership team tomorrow morning.
			</p>
			<p>If you’re tired of strategy being something that lives in a binder instead of the staffroom, this cheat sheet is your first step to changing that.</p>
